## 1. How the information was gathered

2. **Result filtering** – The most relevant hits were those that listed the full technical sheet (Acer’s own product‑detail pages, retailer spec tables, and the ENERGY STAR certification page).  
3. **Data extraction** – From each source I pulled the key hardware details (CPU, RAM, storage, display, graphics, OS, ports, power consumption, weight, etc.) and noted any variations (e.g., RAM size can be 8 GB or 16 GB depending on configuration).  
4. **Cross‑checking** – Where two or more sources agreed on a spec, I treated it as confirmed; where they differed, I reported the range or noted the variation.
