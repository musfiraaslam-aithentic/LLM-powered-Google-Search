## 1. How the information was obtained (reasoning steps)

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Performed a web‑search for **“NBLL‑WXX9 Huawei specifications”**. | Returned several hits, the most promising being a UserBenchmark page and a Geekbench Browser page. |
| **2** | Attempted to open the **UserBenchmark** link (`https://www.userbenchmark.com/System/Huawei-NBLL-WXX9/200614`). | Access was blocked – the site required a login/blocked for the bot, so no data could be extracted. |
| **3** | Opened the **Geekbench Browser** link (`https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/baseline/5986619`). | The page loaded successfully and displayed a full system‑information table for the Huawei NBLL‑WXX9. |
| **4** | Extracted the relevant hardware details from the Geekbench page (CPU, memory, OS, etc.). | Obtained concrete specifications (see Section 2). |
| **5** | Compiled the findings into a concise, structured answer and listed the URLs used as references. | Completed. |
